# MIDI-Project
In this Project the main goal is to create an executable file (play_notes) so that it can play the Mario song in the ev3 Brainstorm environment for the Lego robot , which was my Team's project at university , and in order to do so i had to first write a code in C++ (midi_to_notes.cpp) that wrote all the notes of that song from a midi file (mario.mid) with all their pitch , velocity and delay time into a txt file (notes.txt).
It is also worth mentioning that i wrote the LegoSongPlayer.cpp to check the midi file and play it on my computer with using the right libraries and modules.
